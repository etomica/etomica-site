# Lessons
We compile here material that we have developed to teach theory, methods, and practices of molecular simulation.

Powerpoint lectures developed when teaching CE 525 Molecular Simulation, dating from 2000 with very few updates since. 

The pdf files are more likely to preserve the format and fonts of the original Powerpoint files; the Powerpoint files are provided also, to allow users to edit and update the content.
