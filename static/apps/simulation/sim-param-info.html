<p>The molecular simulation app allows you to set many of the common simulation parameters.  You can choose the ensemble (NVT, NPT, Î¼VT, etc) as well as set the system size and thermodynamic conditions.  If running at constant P or grand canonical, then the density value is used to set the initial condition. The potential and truncation can also be set.</p>

<p>You may choose to run Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD).  If running MD, then you must select a timestep for integration.  MC may use cell lists while MD may use neighbor lists to speed up computations for large systems.  If you'd like to be able to reproduce a run, you can set the random set seed; otherwise a random seed will be chosen.</p>
