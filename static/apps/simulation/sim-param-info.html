<p>The molecular simulation app allows you to set many of the common simulation parameters.  You can choose the ensemble (NVT, NPT, μVT, etc) as well as set the system size and thermodynamic conditions.  If running at constant P or grand canonical, then the density value is used to set the initial condition. The potential and truncation can also be set.</p>

<p>You may choose to run Monte Carlo (MC) or molecular dynamics (MD).  If running MD, then you must select a timestep for integration.  MD uses a Nosé&ndash;Hoover integrator.  MC may use cell lists while MD may use neighbor lists to speed up computations for large systems.  Due to the discontinuity in the hard sphere potential, the hard sphere model is incompatible with MD.  If you'd like to be able to reproduce a run, you can set the seed; otherwise a random seed will be chosen.</p>

<p>The standard potentials have sigma=1 and epsilon=1 along with mass=1.  Boltzmann's constant (k<sub>B</sub>) is also 1.</p>
