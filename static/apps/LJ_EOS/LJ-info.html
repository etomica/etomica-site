            <p>These pages describe the thermodynamic properties of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential'>Lennard-Jones (LJ) model</a> via equations of state (EOS).  The LJ potential has the form</p>
            <p style='margin-left: 2rem'>U(r) = 4 &epsilon; ((&sigma;/r)<sup>12</sup> - (&sigma;/r)<sup>6</sup>)</p>
            <p>Where r is the separation distance between any pair of atoms.  The potential has an attractive well with depth &epsilon; and repulsive core.  The potential goes through 0 at r=&sigma;.</p>
            <p>By deafult, we report thermodynamic properties reduced by both &epsilon; and &sigma;; temperature is reported in terms of k<sub>B</sub>T/&epsilon; and pressure is reported in terms of P&sigma;<sup>3</sup>/&epsilon;, etc.  The resulting values are dimensionless.  They can be converted to values with units for a chemical model by using the appropriate values of &sigma; and &epsilon; for the model.  All thermodynamic properties are intensive &mdash; the values are independent of system size.  Quantities such as potential energy are reported as the potential energy per atom to make them intensive.</p>
            <p>It is possible to set the Lennard-Jones &sigma; and &epsilon; values to specific values, or to set them to values that approximately describe the behavior of a real molecule via the button in the top-right on each page (initially labelled "Reduced LJ").  Having set the model, thermodynamic properties will be reported in unreduced form.  If a real molecule is chosen, then the desired state point and resulting properties are reported in SI units (K, mol/L, Pa, J/mol).  The &sigma; and &epsilon; values are determined from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_corresponding_states'>corresponding states theory</a> &mdash; the parameters are set so that the resulting Lennard-Jones model has the same critical temperature and density as the real fluid.</p>
            <p>The virial coefficients used in the virial equation of state (VEOS) are themselves thermodynamic properties (B<sub>n</sub> = (1/n!T) lim<sub>&rho;&rarr;0</sub> d<sup>n</sup>P/d&rho;<sup>n</sup>).  When working with just the VEOS for the vapor, the page can also provide the virial coefficients.</p>
