            <p>The Lennard-Jones vapor and solid phases are in equilibrium starting at T=0 and extending up to a triple point with the liquid.  Although HCP is more stable than FCC at low T and FCC more stable than HCP at higher T, both are at least metastable for T=0 up to the liquid triple point and this page will trace the whole curve for either choice.  The FCC-HCP-vapor triple point (where the low-T HCP curve terminates and the high-T FCC curve starts) and the FCC-liquid-vapor triple points can be identified on the <a href='triple-point.html'>triple point page</a>.</p>
            <p>At extremely low temperature, the page reports the vapor density and pressure are 0 due to underflow.  Coexistence is found properly, but the vapor density and pressure values are less than 10<sup>-324</sup> and cannot be represented as standard numbers that CPUs handle natively.</p>
