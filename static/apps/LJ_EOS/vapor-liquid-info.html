            <p>The Lennard-Jones vapor and liquid phases are in equilibrium starting at the vapor-liquid-FCC triple point and terminating a critical point.  This page starts below the triple point temperature, where the liquid is metastable and traces the curve until terminating at the specified T<sub>max</sub>.  The default T<sub>max</sub> is 0.9, beyond which the Schultz EOS for the liquid is not valid.  Use of a different liquid EOS allows you to follow the curve to higher temperature.  The script may have trouble finding coexistence near the critical point.</p>
