            <p>Both FCC and HCP have regions of stability for the Lennard-Jones solid.  HCP is more stable at low density and low temperature, while FCC is more stable at all other conditions.  Both structures are close-packed (FCC has A-B-C hexagonal layers while HCP has A-B) and their properties are very similar along the coexistence curve.</p>
            <p>At low temperature, a low-density HCP phase exists in equilibrium with a high-density FCC phase.  As the temperature is increased, the densities approach one another until a maximum in temperature is reached.  Continuing along the curve from there, the temperature decreases along a branch where a high-density HCP phase is in equilibrium with a low-density FCC phase.  The curve terminates at the FCC-HCP-vapor triple point.  This page will trace both parts of the curve (increasing and decreasing temperature) and finally searches for a point where P=0 (which should be close to the triple point).  The FCC-HCP-vapor triple point can be found on the <a href='triple-point.html'>triple point page</a>.</p>
            <p>The correlation for FCC-HCP coexistence provides temperature as a function of FCC density.  Accorindingly, if you subtract it, the FCC density will retain its value for the EOS and the temperature (and other) column will show the difference.
