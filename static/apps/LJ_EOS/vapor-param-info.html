  <li>Schultz (VEOS) is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virial_expansion'>Virial Equation of State</a> using virial coefficients computed for the Lennard-Jones potential.

      <li>The second virial coefficient can be computed quickly (and exactly) via a <a href='https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SecondVirialCoefficientsForTheLennardJones2nNPotential/'>series expansion</a></li>
      <li>The third virial coefficient can be computed quickly (and almost exactly) via FFT.</li>
      <li>Fourth and higher virial coefficients are typically computed via Monte Carlo integration and have an associated uncertainty.  All coefficients used in the Schultz VEOS were computed via Mayer-Sampling Monte Carlo.</li>
      <li>The second and third virial coefficients used on this site are computed on the fly while the fourth and high virial coefficients are taken from fits of virial coefficients computed at discrete temperatures.</li>
      <li>While setting the EOS to not use high-order coefficients at low temperature is likely to have a negligible effect, the high-order coefficients do become more and more important at higher temperature.  Examining the effect of decreasing the VEOS order provides a self-assessment of the convergence of the series.</li>

  <li>Gottschalk's EOS takes correlations for existing virial coefficients and combines them with fits of even higher-order virial coefficients to molecular simulation data from both vapor and liquid conditions.</li>
  <li>Johnson's EOS uses a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin empirical form to fit molecular simulation data collected with a mix of molecular dynamics with 864 atoms and Monte Carlo with 500, both with a potential truncation of at least 4 and included a long-range correction.</li>
  <li>Kolafa's EOS uses a semi-empircal form (incorporating a fit to the second virial coefficient and perturbation from a hard sphere reference) to fit molecular simulation data curated from the literature, augmented with additional simulation data. An <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fluid.2020.112772'>assessment</a> in 2020 found that Kolafa's EOS to have the best overall performance in terms of both precision and robustness.</li>
  <li>May's EOS uses a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin empirical form to fit simulation data at 348 state points.</li>
  <li>Mecke's EOS uses a semi-empircal form (perturbing from a hard sphere reference) to fit molecular simulation data taken from the literature, augmented with additional simulation data.</li>
  <li>Nicolas' EOS uses a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin empirical form to fit molecular simulation data at 108 state points collected with molecular dynamics of 256 atoms, a potential truncation of 2.5 and included a long-range correction.</li>
  <li>Thol's EOS uses an empirical form to fit data from Monte Carlo molecular simulations containing 1372 atoms at about 200 state points.</li>
