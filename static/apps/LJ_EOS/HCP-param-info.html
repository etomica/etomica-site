  <li>Schultz EOS is an equation of state that is split into lattice, harmonic, anharmonic and anisotropic contributions.  Each contribution was computed separately using methods appropriate to each.
  <ul>
    <li>The lattice contribution is independent of system size and sensitive to cutoff, but can be computed for extremely long cutoffs.</li>
    <li>The harmonic contribution can be computed using <a href='https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511619885'>lattice dynamics</a>.  Lattice dynamics is much cheaper than molecular simulations and yield free energy directly.  The harmonic contribution is sensitive to system size and cutoff, but results were collected for various system sizes and cutoffs, including very large systems with long truncation.</li>
    <li>The anharmonic contribution was computed via harmonically-mapped averaging, which is capable of focusing on just the anharmonic part increasing the resulting precision.  The anharmonic properties also tend to be relatively insensitive to both system size and cutoff.
      <ul>
        <li>Simulations were run for various system sizes (number of atoms) and EOS coefficients were determined for each system size.  You can choose the system size via the "# of atoms" parameter.</li>
        <li>Thermodynamic properties for many different cutoffs were measured from each molecular simulation; the simulations sampled a short cutoff, but measured longer cutoffs via reweighting.</li>
        <li>During the simulations, the interacting neighbors were fixed based on the imposed cutoff and iniital configuration.  Atoms that drifted together from outside the cutoff did not interact while atoms that started within the cutoff, but drifted apart continued to interact with an untruncated potential.</li>
        <li>The cutoff was scaled as a function of density (cutoff = 3 means that r<sub>c</sub>&rho;<sup>1/3</sup> = 3) such that the neighbors do not vary with density.</li>
        <li>While you can choose a cutoff to examine the effect of truncation on thermodynamic properties (and the tradeoff between computational cost and accuracy), the properties do not correspond to Lennard-Jones with any specific density-independent cutoff.  Only by including the long range correction (LRC) can proper thermodynamic properties be computed.</li>
        <li>When setting r<sub>c</sub>=&infin;, a cutoff for each contribution is used where the contribution has converged.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The anisotropic contribution arises because the direction perpendicular to the hexagonal layers is different than other directions.  Accordingly, the system may be able to lower its free energy by stretching or compressing the lattice in this direction.  The unit cell is described by its length in the x, y and z directions (a, b, and c).  In the ideal case (where the nearest neighbors all have the same distance), b=3<sup>1/2</sup>a and c=(8/3)<sup>1/2</sup>a.  The lattice stretch can then be characterized by &alpha;=(c/a)(8/3)<sup>-1/2</sup>.  For the ideal lattice, &alpha;=1.  &alpha;&gt;1 indicates stretching of the hexagonal planes away from each other while &alpha;&lt;1 indicates stretching within the planes.
      <ul>
        <li>Like the EOS for the ideal lattice (with &alpha;=1), the contribution due to lattice stretch can also be broken down into lattice, harmonic and anharmonic contributions.  Although the simulations were only capable of measuring the total anisotropic contribution, the lattice and harmonic contributions can still be subtracted to yield an anharmonic contribution.  While this does not improve the precision, the anharmonic contribution for vacancies tends to be insensitive to system size and cutoff.</li>
      </ul>

  <li>Adidharma's EOS split the free energy contributions into a lattice contribution, a term to fix the absolute free energy and a polynomial correction in T and &rho;.  The polynomial coefficients were fit to simulation data for 8712-11520 atoms and a cutoff of 10.  The absolute free energy term was chosen to obtain the triple point predicition made by <a href='https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4944069'>Calero, Knorowski and Travesset</a> when matched with Johnson's EOS to describe both the liquid and vapor.</li>
