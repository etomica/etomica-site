            <p>The EOS coexistence curve pages allows you to construct a coexistence curve for two phases.  You can choose the EOS (and any EOS parameters) to use to generate thermodynamic properties for each phase.  Each page understands how to step through temperatures to construct the full curve and uses estimates of pressure from the result of the previous temperature.</p>
            <p>The coexistence densities, pressure and Gibbs free energy are reported for each temperature in the results table.  You may copy the data as comma-separated data and also open a plot.  For the plot, you can choose the properties plotted for the x and y axes.  If the chosen properties are the same for the two phases (T, P or G), then only a single set is plotted.  If one is different for the two phases, the a separate curve is shown for each phase.  Alternatively, you may choose to plot the difference in such a property to collapse back to a single curve.</p>
            <p>Having generated coexistence data, you can subtract off a correlation for the properties.  For each curve, the correlation describes coexistence properties using the Schultz equations of state.  The correlations provide coexistence densities as a function of temperature.  Other properties (P, G, A, etc) are generated using the Schultz EOS with nominal parameters.  Subtracting the correlation can make it easier to see small differences between different equations of state, or due to changes in parameters.  If you plot the coexistence properties, you can also plot the properties from the correlation.  Correlations are available for vapor-liquid, vapor-FCC, liquid-FCC and FCC-HCP.</p>
