            <p>The EOS coexistence curve pages allows you to construct a coexistence curve for two phases.  You can choose the EOS (and any EOS parameters) to use to generate thermodynamic properties for each phase.  Each page understands how to step through temperatures to construct the full curve and uses estimates of pressure from the result of the previous temperature.</p>
            <p>The coexistence densities, pressure and Gibbs free energy are reported for each temperature in the results table.  You may copy the data as comma-separated data and also open a plot.  For the plot, you can choose the properties plotted for the x and y axes.  If the chosen properties are the same for the two phases (T, P or G), then only a single set is plotted.  If one is different for the two phases, the a separate curve is shown for each phase.  Alternatively, you may choose to plot the difference in such a property to collapse back to a single curve.</p>
