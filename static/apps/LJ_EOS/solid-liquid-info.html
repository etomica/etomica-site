            <p>The Lennard-Jones solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium starting at the vapor-liquid-FCC triple point and extending to the soft-sphere limit at infinite temperature and density.  This page will trace the whole curve from triple point to the soft-sphere limit.  Because the very-high temperature data will throw off the scale of most coexistence plots, maximum values density and temperature can be set.  Alternatively, you can plot v<sup>2</sup> = &rho;<sup>-2</sup> and Y = (4/T)&rho;<sup>-4</sup>, which remain finite over the whole curve.</p>
