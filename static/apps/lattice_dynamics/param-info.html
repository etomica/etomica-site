The lattice dynamics app takes the system size and shape, the crystal structure (unit cell), density and interatomic potential as parameters.  Several predefined crystal structures are available, but it is also possible define a custom crystal structure by specifying the unit cell dimensions and relative locations of the basis atoms.  When specifying the unit cell dimensions, it is unnecessary to get its absolute size correct; the unit cell will be scaled up or down to achieve the target density.

The Simple+LRC truncation scheme applies simple truncation, but extends the truncation by 5x when computing contributions to the dynamical matrix for k=0 as well as the "self" sum.  The self sum is the primary source of truncation error and so extending the truncation provides an effective correction without substantial cost; most of the cost is still due to constructing the dynamical matrix for each wave vector and the diagonalizing those matrices.
