The lattice dynamics app takes the system size and shape, the crystal structure (unit cell), density and interatomic potential as parameters.  Several predefined crystal structures are available, but it is also possible define a custom crystal structure by specifying the unit cell dimensions and relative locations of the basis atoms.  When specifying the unit cell dimensions, it is unnecessary to get its absolute size correct; the unit cell will be scaled up or down to achieve the target density.
