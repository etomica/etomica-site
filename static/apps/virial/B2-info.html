<p>B<sub>2</sub> can be computed for any spherical potential via simple quadrature.  Additionally, B<sub>2</sub> for square-well is a simple expression, B<sub>2</sub> for soft-spheres is more easily expressible as a constant times the gamma function and B<sub>2</sub> for Lennard-Jones can be expressed as a series expansion of gamma functions.  The faster methods are used when computing B<sub>2</sub> for untruncated soft spheres or Lennard-Jones, while quadrature is used for all other choices.  The coefficient value along with its first two derivatives with inverse temperature (&beta;=1/k<sub>B</sub>T) are reported.  When quadrature is used, the results using between 2<sup>10</sup> &asymp; 10<sup>3</sup> and 2<sup>20</sup> &asymp; 10<sup>6</sup> quadrature points (distnaces where the interaction potential and Mayer function are evaluated) are reported to provide a measure of convergence.</p>

<p>The temperature may also be varied parametrically with values computed for each temperature.  In this mode, only the values for 2<sup>20</sup> quadrature points are reported.  The resulting data may be saved as a named set and then returned to later.  The values may also be plotted as a function of temperature along with any saved set.</p>
