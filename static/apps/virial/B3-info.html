<p>B<sub>3</sub> can be computed for any spherical potential via <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_Transform'>fast-Fourier transforms</a> (FFT).  The computational cost of FFT calculations scale like N ln(N), where N is the number of distances where the interaction (and Mayer function) is evaluated.  This is dramatically faster than using direct quadrature, which would scale like N<sup>3</sup>.  The results, including the first two derivatives of the coefficient with invrese temperature (&beta;=1/k<sub>B</sub>T) are reported, using N ranging from 2<sup>5</sup> to 2<sup>16</sup> to provide a measure of convergence.</p>
