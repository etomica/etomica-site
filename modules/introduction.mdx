This page provides access to a suite of instructional modules based in molecular simulation. Their purpose is to foster molecular understanding of phenomena and processes commonly taught in standard science and engineering courses. They are interactive, graphically oriented, and quantitative (i.e., they provide real data for the models being simulated). Instructions, examples, and homework problems are provided as part of most modules; these resources may be accessed from the corresponding links in the Index of Molecular Simulation Modules, below.

The modules differ in the level of understanding needed to fully appreciate them, covering a range of topics across high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. However, they are all easy to run and control, and anyone with an interest in physics and chemistry should be able to learn from them.

This is a project of [CACHE](https://www.cache.org). Funding for this development has been provided by the National Science Foundation, Grants DUE-9752243 and DUE-0618521.

### Download Instructions

**[Latest Release](https://github.com/etomica/etomica/releases/latest)**

The modules are distributed together as a single self-contained application that allows selecting and launching individual modules. Note that this distribution does not require Java to be installed on your system!

You can download the latest build from GitHub [here](https://github.com/etomica/etomica/releases/latest) and run the application from the zip archive. On MacOS and
Windows your system may need to be configured to allow running unsigned applications. 

### Key Bindings
For most of the modules, some of the keys on your keyboard can be used to manipulate the configuration display.  

First, make sure the focus is on the configuration display (select the Configuration tab and click somewhere in the display).

Then, keypresses will perform the actions as follows:

1. The 1 key causes display of the first shell of periodic images (2 does the 2nd as well, etc.); 0 returns to just the original central image. Also, in 3D, the i key will toggle between two displays of image shells.
2. The b key ("boundary") affects the presentation of the boundary boxes when multiple image shells are displayed. In 3D, it cycles through several options when pressed multiple times; in 2D there are only two such options, but it takes several presses to cycle through them.  
3. The o key will toggle drawing of "overlap images", i.e., parts of images that fall in a neighboring box. This applies only if periodic images are displayed.  The effect is rather subtle (2D only).
4. +/- keys (without shift key) zooms in/out (3D only).
5. The x,y,z keys will rotate about respective axes (3D only).
6. The h key ("home") will present the view in the standard orientation and size.
7. The p key toggles the perspective on/off (3D only).
8. Arrow keys will move the image left/right/up/down (3D only).

Remember to have the focus on the configuration when applying these!

Additionally, the mouse can be used to manipulate 3D images:

1. Click on the image and drag to rotate.
2. Hold the Shift key and click while moving the mouse vertically changes the zoom level.
