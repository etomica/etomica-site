This page provides access to a suite of instructional modules based in molecular simulation. Their purpose is to foster molecular understanding of phenomena and processes commonly taught in standard science and engineering courses. They are interactive, graphically oriented, and quantitative (i.e., they provide real data for the models being simulated). Instructions, examples, and homework problems are provided as part of most modules; these resources may be accessed from the corresponding links in the Index of Molecular Simulation Modules, below.

The modules differ in the level of understanding needed to fully appreciate them, covering a range of topics across high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. However, they are all easy to run and control, and anyone with an interest in physics and chemistry should be able to learn from them.

This is a project of [CACHE](https://www.cache.org). Funding for this development has been provided by the National Science Foundation, Grants DUE-9752243 and DUE-0618521.

### Download Instructions

**[Latest Release](https://github.com/etomica/etomica/releases/latest)**

The modules are distributed together as a single self-contained application that allows selecting and launching individual modules. Note that this distribution does not require Java to be installed on your system!

You can download the latest build from GitHub [here](https://github.com/etomica/etomica/releases/latest) and run the application from the zip archive. On MacOS and
Windows your system may need to be configured to allow running unsigned applications.
