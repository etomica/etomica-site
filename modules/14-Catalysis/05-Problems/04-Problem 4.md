4.  Investigate a second catalyst material, catalyst B for its reaction behavior.  
    a. Is the rate of reaction the same for catalyst B as it is for catalyst A?  Does the rate law you generated in problems #1-2 succeed or fail to capture the reaction kinetics for this catalyst?  
    b. Can you determine what chemical/physical phenomenon is causing the difference in rate?  
    c. To mitigate this problem with catalyst B, which square well potential parameter(s) would you adjust?  Could this parameter affect other aspects of the reaction chemistry?
