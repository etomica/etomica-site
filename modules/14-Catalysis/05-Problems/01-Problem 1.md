1. Determine the dependence of the rate of reaction (CO<sub>2</sub> production) on the concentrations of the reactants (reaction orders) for isothermal catalytic CO oxidation at 600 K on catalyst A.  To help discern the concentration effects, it may be useful to graph the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production vs. each speciesâ€™ concentration. Propose a catalytic rate law (not just a power law model) for this system.  To accomplish this task, you will need to have [reaction rate information](<../Background/Determination of Rate Law Parameters>), which can come from an analysis of real-time simulation data (see [Fogler or Laidler](../References)).  [Determine rate and equilibrium constants](<../Background/Determination of Rate Law Parameters>) for you proposed rate law for the given catalyst A system at 600 K, using the data collected.
