**Problem 1.** Run both simulations from Examples 1 and 2 by yourself, and consider the deformation-versus-time curves. Why does the Atomistic curve have much bigger fluctuations than the Continuum curve, even though the number of particles is similar for both?

**Problem 2.** In the Atomistic simulation, how would you decide which atoms to assign to the vapor phase (blue) as opposed to the liquid phase (red)?

**Problem 3.** Carry out a Continuum simulation with the following parameters.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Time step: 0.2

&nbsp; &nbsp; Number of Atoms: 1000

&nbsp; &nbsp; Initial Deformation: 0.0

&nbsp; &nbsp; Cohesion Strength (Bulk Cohesion): 1.0

&nbsp; &nbsp; Squeezing Force: 4.0

&nbsp; &nbsp; Simulation Duration: 6.0 time units

What is the final deformation? What is the final effective radius (a check on volume conservation)? Repeat the simulation with the same parameters except for a smaller time step (0.1) and twice as many particles (2000). How close are the deformation-versus-time curves? How much better is volume conserved? By extrapolating the computer run time for the first simulation, how long would you expect the new simulation to take? Does this match up with the actual time required?
