A powerful mathematical property discovered by Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier, the Fourier
Transform has numerous applications. Basically the idea behind it is that any
continuous function can be represented as a sum of sin and cosine waves of
varying amplitude and phases. The transform produces a new function of
amplitudes with a frequency domain. 

There are numerous applications for this property. Two
notable ones include (1) a function can be re-characterized into series of
more manageable (and perhaps actually solvable) equations; (2) an unknown wave
made up of multiple frequencies (think sound waves) can be broken down to its
component parts for comparison with other waves.

This simulation transforms the displacements to accomplish
both previously said reasons, however more so the latter. Initial conditions
are set up from a series of wave equations, and run concurrently on one set of
atoms. The simulation can monitor the motion and break it down to its wave
component parts. Also given an unknown equation or set of motion, the
simulation can monitor the motion and describe it in a way that is easier to
understand, interpret, and compare.
