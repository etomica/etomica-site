After initial conditions are set up, and the simulation is
started. The simulation decides the motion of the atoms by their current
velocities and the force interactions between other atoms, among other factors.
The characterization of the interactions is converted into a mathematical model
detailing force exerted as a function of distance. Such a model is called a
potential. And in this simulation, we are using harmonic potentials. As the
name might suggest, the atoms follow interactions and produce forces following
the properties of Simple Harmonic Motion. The forces between atoms accelerate 
and decelerate the motion of the atoms.  

An easy way to imagine how they interact is by picturing each atom attached to its neighbors by springs as they are in the  Bravais Lattice. The springs are perfect harmonic springs, and they produce forces equal to displacement times spring constant $(F = kx)$.
