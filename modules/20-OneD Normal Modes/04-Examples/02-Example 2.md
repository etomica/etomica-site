From Example 1, go to the Displacement Transform pane. Now increment the Anharmonicity slide to 1. Note how the initial main non-zero values “bleed” outwards. This means that the initial clean wave is breaking up into multiple smaller waves. Over time you can see it bleed further. Now deselect the displacement transform checkbox. Note how changed the wave has become. No longer a smooth rolling wave, it now sort of “flops” about aimlessly. This was accomplished by adding a cubic term to the harmonic potential that subsequently degrades the wave over time.�

Pause the simulation, set the Anharmonicity to 0, and press reset in order to re-initialize the program (although using current values and settings).
