**Forming Vacancies and their effects on fracture**

Reset the simulation to have the same initial conditions as in the previous example by pressing the Reset for SSF (Stress Strain Fracture)and Reset Averages buttons.  Holding down the 'a' key and left clicking with the mouse, remove several atoms from the simulation to create vacancies as shown below.

Now run the simulation with the vacancies, gradually increasing the spring constant value until cracks form and fractures occurs.
