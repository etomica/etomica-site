*These problems are suitable for graduate students in material science and molecular simulation courses.*

1.From Problem 4, Level 2, can the module catch the other pattern of the curve? Can you guess why or why not? If not, is there a way to show it with basis of the molecular simulation?
1.Search experimental results of the tensile test on a simple cubic material and a face centered cubic material. Set up the module like the experiment as close as possible. Can you reproduce the results with using the module? Can you catch any undetermined information of the experiment by running simulations? Explain explicitly why you can reproduce some results by using the module and why not?
