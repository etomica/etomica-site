**Simulation**

With the structure of the triangular lattice and a continuous increase of spring constants at a certain interval of time, observe and record five properties from the table in the module (gage length, load, elongation, and stress and strain) at room temperature until the structure factures.

1.Compute values of stress and strain from load and elongation data and verify those values with recorded ones to be same. Describe a relationship between the spring constant and the externally tensile force on molecules in the simulation. Describe qualitatively how to calculate load and elongation data?
1.Repeat simulation 1 with different number of vacancies. What kinds of phenomena can be observed during the simulation? What are effects of vacancies on material fractures? Is there any dependence of the number of vacancies on fracture?
1.Repeat simulation 1 with different temperatures. What are effects of the change of temperature on material fractures?
1.Start the simulation with a spring constant, which is not big enough to break the material instantly and gradually increase the spring constant until the structure fractures. Do this on both structures and record five properties from the table. What kinds of phenomena can be observed with square lattice? Which structure is more strong or stable? Make sure to set any physical properties to be same for both cases.
