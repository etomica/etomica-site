1. Start the simulation with mu1 = -1000 and mu2 = 0. Cut the tube and watch the system move to steady state. Change the chemical potentials and observe the simulation.
2. Using the same chemical potentials at the completion of Problem 1, restrict the temperature of the system by choosing a specific value.
3. Allow the system to reach steady state and use the module to calculate the diffusivity:
4. What is the flux?
5. What is the slope of Density vs. Normalized Distance?
6. Plug your values into Fick's Law : $J = -D\frac{dc}{dx}$
